I am a Ph.D. student at the [School of Cyber Science and Technology](http://cst.buaa.edu.cn/) of [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn). My research mainly focuses on privacy-preserving computations and applied cryptography, such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). I enjoy the theoretical algorithms and the practical applications of advanced cryptographic primitives to build solutions for diverse privacy-preserving computation tasks.
